## Testing Methodology

For each lab's operations test file (`test_lab_XX_operations.py`):

1. **Identify Core Operations**
   - List every distinct Cypher operation taught
   - Note calculation formulas
   - Document pattern variations

2. **Create Operation Tests**
   - Test that the operation executes without error
   - Validate results are reasonable/expected
   - Check edge cases work

3. **Validate Calculations**
   - Test mathematical operations produce correct results
   - Verify aggregations work as expected
   - Check derived metrics are calculable

4. **Pattern Coverage**
   - Ensure each Cypher pattern type is tested
   - Validate complex multi-hop patterns
   - Check conditional logic works

## Success Criteria

**100% Operations Coverage Achieved When:**
- ✅ Every Cypher operation taught has a test
- ✅ Every calculation formula is validated
- ✅ Every pattern variation is executable
- ✅ All analytical operations produce results
- ✅ Edge cases and null handling work

**Current Status:**
- Data Validation: **100%** (17/17 labs)
- Operations Validation: **~10%** (1/17 labs complete)

**Target:** 100% operations coverage for all 17 labs
