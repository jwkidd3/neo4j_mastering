# Neo4j Lab 16: Multi-Line Insurance Platform

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Prerequisites:** Labs 1-15 completed successfully  

In this lab, you'll expand your insurance database to a comprehensive multi-line platform supporting life insurance, commercial coverage, specialty products, and global reinsurance operations. You'll implement advanced enterprise features including multi-currency support, international regulations, and complex partner ecosystems.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- ✅ **Implement life insurance products** with beneficiaries, cash values, and term structures
- ✅ **Build commercial insurance systems** supporting general liability, workers compensation, and cyber coverage
- ✅ **Design specialty insurance products** including professional liability and umbrella policies
- ✅ **Create reinsurance networks** with treaty management and risk distribution
- ✅ **Implement global operations** with multi-country compliance and currency management
- ✅ **Build partner ecosystems** including brokers, reinsurers, and specialty providers

---

## Lab Environment Setup

### Step 1: Verify Docker Environment
```bash
# Ensure Neo4j Enterprise container is running
docker ps | grep neo4j

# Container should show: neo4j (Neo4j/2025.06.0 neo4j:enterprise)
```

### Step 2: Connect to Neo4j
```python
# In Jupyter, verify connection
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, date
import uuid

# Connect to Neo4j Enterprise instance
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

def run_query(query, parameters=None):
    with driver.session(database="insurance") as session:
        result = session.run(query, parameters)
        return [record.data() for record in result]

# Verify current database state
current_state = run_query("""
MATCH (n) 
RETURN labels(n)[0] AS node_type, count(n) AS count
ORDER BY count DESC
""")

print("Current Database State:")
for record in current_state:
    print(f"  {record['node_type']}: {record['count']} nodes")
```
