## Part 1: User Engagement Analytics (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Connect to Social Database and Verify Advanced Data
```cypher
// Switch to social database from Lab 3
:use social
```

```cypher
// Verify comprehensive data from all previous labs
MATCH (u:User) 
RETURN count(u) AS total_users,
       count(DISTINCT u.location) AS unique_locations,
       count(DISTINCT u.profession) AS unique_professions
```

```cypher
MATCH ()-[r:FOLLOWS]->() 
RETURN count(r) AS follow_relationships
```

```cypher
MATCH ()-[r:LIKES]->() 
RETURN count(r) AS like_interactions
```

```cypher
MATCH (p:Post)
RETURN count(p) AS total_posts,
       collect(DISTINCT p.postId)[0..5] AS sample_post_ids,
       collect(DISTINCT keys(p))[0] AS available_properties
```

### Step 2: Calculate Advanced User Engagement Metrics
```cypher
// Comprehensive user activity and engagement analysis

## Quick Reference

**Business Analytics Patterns:**
```cypher
// Cohort analysis template
MATCH (entity) 
WITH date.truncate('month', entity.timestamp) AS cohort, entity
// Add activity measurements
WITH cohort, count(entity) AS cohort_size, activity_metrics
RETURN cohort, cohort_size, retention_calculations

// Segmentation template  
MATCH (entity)
WITH entity, calculated_scores
// Apply scoring logic
RETURN entity, segment_classification, behavioral_patterns

// Trending analysis template
MATCH (content)
WITH content, recency_weight * engagement_metrics AS trending_score
RETURN content, trending_score, trend_classification
```
