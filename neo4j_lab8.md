## Part 1: Advanced Community Detection (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Hierarchical Community Detection
```cypher
// Implement hierarchical community detection using modularity optimization
MATCH (u:User)
// Initialize each user in their own community
SET u.community_level_0 = id(u),
    u.community_level_1 = null,
    u.community_level_2 = null

// Level 1: Merge communities based on strong connections
MATCH (u1:User)-[r:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
WHERE r.relationship IN ['close', 'friend'] AND r.notificationsEnabled = true

// Calculate connection strength between communities
WITH u1.community_level_0 AS comm1, u2.community_level_0 AS comm2, count(r) AS edge_weight
WHERE comm1 <> comm2
ORDER BY edge_weight DESC

// Merge top connected communities
WITH collect({comm1: comm1, comm2: comm2, weight: edge_weight})[0..10] AS top_connections
UNWIND top_connections AS connection

MATCH (u1:User {community_level_0: connection.comm1})
MATCH (u2:User {community_level_0: connection.comm2})
SET u1.community_level_1 = connection.comm1,
    u2.community_level_1 = connection.comm1

       size(apoc.coll.toSet([m IN members | m.location])) AS geographic_diversity,
       // Calculate internal connection strength
       reduce(total_strength = 0, m1 IN members |
         total_strength + size([(m1)-[:FOLLOWS]->(m2:User) WHERE m2 IN members | 1])
       ) AS internal_connections,
       // Community classification
       CASE 
         WHEN size(members) > 4 THEN 'Large Community'

         ELSE 'Small Group'
       END AS community_type
ORDER BY community_size DESC, internal_connections DESC
```

### Step 2: Louvain Method Implementation
```cypher
// Simplified Louvain method for community detection
MATCH (u:User)

WHERE modularity_gain > 0
ORDER BY u, modularity_gain DESC

// Move users to communities with highest modularity gain
WITH u, collect(target_community)[0] AS best_community
WHERE best_community IS NOT NULL
SET u.louvain_community = best_community

// Analyze Louvain communities
MATCH (u:User)
WITH u.louvain_community AS community, collect(u) AS members

// Calculate community metrics
UNWIND members AS m1
UNWIND members AS m2
WHERE m1 <> m2
OPTIONAL MATCH (m1)-[:FOLLOWS]->(m2)

UNWIND connections AS conn
WITH u1, conn.user AS u2, conn.shared AS shared_count
WHERE shared_count >= 2  // Minimum shared interests threshold

       // Calculate bridging potential
       size(member_communities) * (size(member_communities) - 1) / 2 AS bridge_potential
ORDER BY community_count DESC, bridge_potential DESC
```

### Step 4: Community Evolution Analysis
```cypher
// Analyze how communities change over time based on relationship formation
MATCH (u1:User)-[r:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)
WITH date.truncate('month', r.since) AS month, u1, u2
ORDER BY month

// Track community formation over time
