# Neo4j Lab 8: Performance Optimization for Production Insurance Systems

## Overview
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Objective:** Implement strategic indexing, query optimization, and monitoring techniques to prepare the insurance database for production-scale performance and scalability

Building on Lab 7's graph algorithms, you'll now optimize the database for production workloads by implementing performance indexes, query optimization strategies, memory management, and monitoring systems essential for enterprise insurance operations.

---

## Part 1: Performance Baseline and Query Analysis (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Establish Performance Baseline
Let's start by measuring current query performance and identifying optimization opportunities:

```cypher
// Check current database statistics
CALL apoc.meta.stats() YIELD labels, relTypes, stats
RETURN labels, relTypes, stats.nodes AS total_nodes, stats.relationships AS total_relationships
```

### Step 2: Analyze Current Index Status
```cypher
// Check existing indexes and constraints
SHOW INDEXES YIELD name, labelsOrTypes, properties, type, state
RETURN name, labelsOrTypes, properties, type, state
ORDER BY type, name
```

```cypher
// Check existing constraints
SHOW CONSTRAINTS YIELD name, labelsOrTypes, properties, type
RETURN name, labelsOrTypes, properties, type
ORDER BY type, name
```

### Step 3: Profile Common Insurance Queries
```cypher
// Profile a common customer lookup query
PROFILE MATCH (c:Customer {customer_number: "CUST-001234"})
RETURN c.first_name, c.last_name, c.lifetime_value, c.risk_tier
```

```cypher
// Profile a policy search query
PROFILE MATCH (c:Customer)-[:HOLDS_POLICY]->(p:Policy)
WHERE p.policy_status = "Active" AND p.annual_premium > 1000
RETURN c.customer_number, p.policy_number, p.annual_premium
LIMIT 10
```

### Step 4: Identify Slow Query Patterns
```cypher
// Profile agent performance query
PROFILE MATCH (a:Agent)-[:SERVICES]->(c:Customer)-[:HOLDS_POLICY]->(p:Policy)
WHERE a.territory = "Central Texas"
RETURN a.first_name + " " + a.last_name AS agent_name,
       count(c) AS customers,
       sum(p.annual_premium) AS total_premium
```

---

## Part 2: Strategic Index Implementation (15 minutes)

### Step 5: Create Business-Critical Indexes
```cypher
// Create unique constraints for business identifiers
CREATE CONSTRAINT customer_number_unique IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:Customer) REQUIRE c.customer_number IS UNIQUE
```

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT policy_number_unique IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (p:Policy) REQUIRE p.policy_number IS UNIQUE
```

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT agent_id_unique IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (a:Agent) REQUIRE a.agent_id IS UNIQUE
```

### Step 6: Create Performance Indexes for Customer Queries
```cypher
// Index for customer risk tier queries
CREATE INDEX customer_risk_tier IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:Customer) ON (c.risk_tier)
```

```cypher
// Index for customer city/state geographic queries
CREATE INDEX customer_location IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:Customer) ON (c.city, c.state)
```

```cypher
// Index for customer lifetime value queries
CREATE INDEX customer_ltv IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:Customer) ON (c.lifetime_value)
```

```cypher
// Index for customer credit score
CREATE INDEX customer_credit_score IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:Customer) ON (c.credit_score)
```

### Step 7: Create Policy and Claims Indexes
```cypher
// Index for policy status queries
CREATE INDEX policy_status IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (p:Policy) ON (p.policy_status)
```

```cypher
// Index for policy premium range queries
CREATE INDEX policy_premium IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (p:Policy) ON (p.annual_premium)
```

```cypher
// Index for policy expiration date monitoring
CREATE INDEX policy_expiration IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (p:Policy) ON (p.expiration_date)
```

```cypher
// Index for claim status and amount
CREATE INDEX claim_status IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (cl:Claim) ON (cl.claim_status)
```

```cypher
CREATE INDEX claim_amount IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (cl:Claim) ON (cl.claim_amount)
```

### Step 8: Create Agent Performance Indexes
```cypher
// Index for agent territory queries
CREATE INDEX agent_territory IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (a:Agent) ON (a.territory)
```

```cypher
// Index for agent performance rating
CREATE INDEX agent_performance IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (a:Agent) ON (a.performance_rating)
```

### Step 9: Verify Index Creation and Usage
```cypher
// Verify all indexes were created successfully
SHOW INDEXES YIELD name, labelsOrTypes, properties, type, state
WHERE state = "ONLINE"
RETURN name, labelsOrTypes, properties, type
ORDER BY labelsOrTypes, name
```

### Step 10: Test Index Performance Improvement
```cypher
// Test improved customer lookup performance
PROFILE MATCH (c:Customer {customer_number: "CUST-001234"})
RETURN c.first_name, c.last_name, c.lifetime_value, c.risk_tier
```

```cypher
// Test improved policy search performance
PROFILE MATCH (c:Customer)-[:HOLDS_POLICY]->(p:Policy)
WHERE p.policy_status = "Active" AND p.annual_premium > 1000
RETURN c.customer_number, p.policy_number, p.annual_premium
LIMIT 10
```

## Part 3: Query Optimization Strategies (12 minutes)

### Step 11: Optimize Complex Insurance Queries
```cypher
// Optimized customer portfolio analysis
EXPLAIN MATCH (c:Customer)
WHERE c.risk_tier = "Preferred" AND c.lifetime_value > 10000
WITH c
MATCH (c)-[:HOLDS_POLICY]->(p:Policy)
WHERE p.policy_status = "Active"
RETURN c.customer_number,
       c.first_name + " " + c.last_name AS customer_name,
       c.lifetime_value,
       count(p) AS active_policies,
       sum(p.annual_premium) AS total_premium
ORDER BY total_premium DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### Step 12: Optimize Agent Territory Analysis
```cypher
// Optimized agent performance query with early filtering
EXPLAIN MATCH (a:Agent)
WHERE a.territory = "Central Texas" AND a.performance_rating IN ["Excellent", "Very Good"]
WITH a
MATCH (a)-[:SERVICES]->(c:Customer)-[:HOLDS_POLICY]->(p:Policy)
WHERE p.policy_status = "Active"
RETURN a.agent_id,
       a.first_name + " " + a.last_name AS agent_name,
       a.performance_rating,
       count(DISTINCT c) AS customers_served,
       count(p) AS policies_managed,
       sum(p.annual_premium) AS portfolio_value
ORDER BY portfolio_value DESC
```

### Step 13: Optimize Claims Analysis with Pagination
```cypher
// Optimized claims query with proper filtering and pagination
EXPLAIN MATCH (cl:Claim)
WHERE cl.claim_status = "Open" AND cl.claim_amount > 5000
WITH cl
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:FILED_CLAIM]->(cl)
OPTIONAL MATCH (cl)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(vendor)
RETURN cl.claim_number,
       cl.claim_amount,
       cl.incident_date,
       c.customer_number,
       c.first_name + " " + c.last_name AS customer_name,
       COALESCE(vendor.business_name, "Not Assigned") AS assigned_vendor
ORDER BY cl.claim_amount DESC, cl.incident_date DESC
SKIP 0 LIMIT 25
```

### Step 14: Memory-Efficient Aggregation Queries
```cypher
// Memory-efficient geographic analysis with streaming
MATCH (c:Customer)
WHERE c.state = "TX"
WITH c.city AS city, 
     count(*) AS customer_count,
     avg(c.lifetime_value) AS avg_ltv,
     sum(c.lifetime_value) AS total_ltv
WHERE customer_count >= 3
RETURN city,
       customer_count,
       round(avg_ltv * 100) / 100 AS avg_lifetime_value,
       round(total_ltv * 100) / 100 AS total_lifetime_value
ORDER BY total_ltv DESC
```

### Step 15: Optimize Cross-Reference Queries
```cypher
// Optimized customer-agent-policy analysis with strategic WITH clauses
MATCH (c:Customer)
WHERE c.risk_tier IN ["Preferred", "Standard"] 
  AND c.lifetime_value > 8000
WITH c
MATCH (a:Agent)-[:SERVICES]->(c)
WHERE a.performance_rating IN ["Excellent", "Very Good"]
WITH c, a
MATCH (c)-[:HOLDS_POLICY]->(p:Policy)
WHERE p.policy_status = "Active"
RETURN a.territory AS territory,
       count(DISTINCT c) AS high_value_customers,
       count(p) AS total_policies,
       avg(c.lifetime_value) AS avg_customer_value,
       sum(p.annual_premium) AS total_premium_volume
ORDER BY total_premium_volume DESC
```

## Troubleshooting

### If index creation fails:
- Check for existing data conflicts: `MATCH (n:Customer) RETURN n.customer_number, count(*) ORDER BY count(*) DESC`
- Drop conflicting indexes: `DROP INDEX index_name IF EXISTS`
- Verify sufficient disk space and memory

### If queries still perform poorly after indexing:
- Use PROFILE to verify index usage: Look for "NodeByLabelScan" vs "NodeIndexSeek"
- Check for missing WHERE clauses that prevent index usage
- Consider composite indexes for multi-property filters

### If monitoring shows high memory usage:
- Implement query limits: Add LIMIT clauses to prevent large result sets
- Use streaming aggregations: Break large queries into smaller chunks
- Clean up graph projections: Ensure GDS projections are dropped after use
