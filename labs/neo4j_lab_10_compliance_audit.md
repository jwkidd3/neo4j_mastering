# Neo4j Lab 10: Enterprise Compliance & Audit Systems

## Overview
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Objective:** Implement comprehensive regulatory compliance tracking, audit trail systems, and automated reporting for enterprise insurance operations with complete data lineage and privacy protection

Building on Lab 9's fraud detection systems, you'll now create enterprise-grade compliance and audit capabilities that ensure regulatory adherence, complete data traceability, and automated reporting for state and federal insurance requirements.

## Part 1: Regulatory Compliance Framework Setup (12 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Regulatory Bodies and Compliance Requirements
Let's establish the regulatory framework for insurance compliance:

```cypher

### Step 3: Create Compliance Monitoring and Assessment
```cypher

## Part 2: Data Lineage and Audit Trail Implementation (15 minutes)

### Step 4: Create Comprehensive Audit Trail System
```cypher

### Step 6: Implement Data Lineage Tracking
```cypher
// Create data lineage for customer-policy relationships

## Part 4: Automated Compliance Reporting (8 minutes)

### Step 11: Create Regulatory Reporting System
```cypher

## Troubleshooting

### If compliance assessments show unexpected results:
- Verify source data exists: `MATCH (c:Claim) WHERE c.report_date IS NOT NULL RETURN count(c)`
- Check date calculations: `MATCH (c:Claim) RETURN c.incident_date, c.report_date, duration.between(c.incident_date, c.report_date).days`
- Validate business rules match regulatory requirements

### If audit trails are not capturing all events:
- Ensure triggers are properly configured for data modification events
- Check user authentication and session tracking integration
- Verify all business-critical operations include audit trail creation

### If privacy controls seem incomplete:
- Review data classification coverage: `MATCH (a:AuditTrail) RETURN DISTINCT a.data_classification`
- Validate retention policies cover all data types
- Check data subject rights request processing workflows
