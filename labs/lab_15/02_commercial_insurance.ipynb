    "### What You've Accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created **General Liability Insurance** products for commercial operations\n",
    "- Created **Workers Compensation Insurance** with payroll-based rating\n",
    "- Created **Cyber Liability Insurance** with comprehensive breach response coverage\n",
    "- Built business customer profiles with NAICS codes and industry classifications\n",
    "- Implemented multi-policy commercial accounts with package coverage\n",
    "- Established risk profiles including security certifications and loss history\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Commercial Insurance Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Line Commercial Coverage**: Businesses require diverse insurance products working together\n",
    "2. **Industry-Based Underwriting**: NAICS/SIC codes drive risk classification and pricing\n",
    "3. **Payroll Rating Basis**: Workers comp premiums calculated per $100 of payroll by job classification\n",
    "4. **Experience Modification**: Historical loss experience adjusts pricing (0.95 = 5% credit)\n",
    "5. **Cyber Risk Management**: Modern businesses face significant technology-related exposures\n",
