    "### What You've Accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created **Professional Liability (E&O)** products with claims-made coverage\n",
    "- Created **Umbrella Liability** products providing excess coverage over primary policies\n",
    "- Implemented retroactive dates for professional liability coverage\n",
    "- Built coverage towers with coordinated limits and attachment points\n",
    "- Established underlying policy requirements for umbrella coverage\n",
    "- Analyzed specialty coverage coordination and limit adequacy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Specialty Insurance Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Claims-Made Coverage**: Understanding time-based coverage triggers and retroactive dates\n",
    "2. **Coverage Towers**: How excess policies layer over primary coverage to create protection\n",
    "3. **Attachment Points**: The point at which umbrella coverage begins to respond\n",
    "4. **Drop-Down Coverage**: Umbrella filling gaps in underlying coverage subject to SIR\n",
    "5. **Extended Reporting Periods**: Tail coverage for claims-made policies when coverage ends\n",
    "6. **Defense Costs**: In addition to vs. within policy limits significantly impacts effective coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coverage Tower Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the technology company:\n",
    "- **Primary General Liability**: $2M per occurrence (ground layer)\n",
    "- **Umbrella Liability**: $10M excess of $2M (second layer)\n",
    "- **Total Protection**: $12M total liability coverage\n",
    "- **Professional Liability**: $5M per claim (separate tower for professional risks)\n",
