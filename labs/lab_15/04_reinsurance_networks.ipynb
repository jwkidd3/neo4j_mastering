    "## Step 2: Understanding Reinsurance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context: Reinsurance Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Reinsurance?**\n",
    "- \"Insurance for insurance companies\"\n",
    "- Primary insurer (ceding company) transfers risk to reinsurer\n",
    "- Allows insurers to write more business than capital alone would permit\n",
    "- Protects against large losses and catastrophic events\n",
    "- Stabilizes financial results year over year\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Reinsurance Treaties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Catastrophe Excess of Loss**\n",
    "   - Covers losses exceeding a specified retention (attachment point)\n",
    "   - Primary use: Protection against natural catastrophes\n",
    "   - Example: $50M excess of $5M (reinsurer pays losses from $5M to $55M)\n",
    "   - Reinstatements: Right to restore coverage after loss (at additional premium)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quota Share**\n",
    "   - Reinsurer takes fixed percentage of all policies in covered class\n",
    "   - Pro-rata sharing of premiums and losses\n",
    "   - Ceding commission paid to primary insurer for acquisition costs\n",
    "   - Profit commission if loss ratio favorable\n",
    "   - Example: 25% quota share on commercial lines\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Surplus Share**\n",
    "   - Primary insurer retains amount up to line limit\n",
    "   - Reinsurer takes surplus above retention, up to treaty capacity\n",
    "   - Variable cession percentage by policy\n",
    "   - Common for specialty and professional liability\n",
    "   - Example: Retain $1M, cede surplus up to $10M treaty capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial Strength Ratings:**\n",
    "- A.M. Best ratings measure reinsurer financial strength\n",
    "- A++ and A+ = Superior\n",
    "- A and A- = Excellent\n",
    "- Ratings critical for regulatory approval and credit risk"

    "## Step 6: Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created **reinsurance company partnerships** with major global reinsurers\n",
    "- Built **catastrophe excess of loss treaties** for natural disaster protection\n",
    "- Implemented **quota share treaties** for proportional risk sharing\n",
    "- Created **surplus share treaties** for specialty and professional liability\n",
    "- Established multi-party syndication structures with participation percentages\n",
    "- Analyzed treaty performance, loss ratios, and commission structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Reinsurance Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Risk Transfer Mechanisms**: Understanding how insurers transfer catastrophic risk to reinsurers\n",
    "2. **Treaty Structures**: Different treaty types serve different risk management objectives\n",
    "3. **Syndication**: Multiple reinsurers share capacity to provide large coverage amounts\n",
    "4. **Financial Strength**: A.M. Best ratings critical for reinsurer selection and regulatory approval\n",
    "5. **Commission Structures**: Ceding commissions compensate for acquisition costs, profit commissions align interests\n",
    "6. **Loss Ratios**: Key performance metric for treaty profitability (losses / premium)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinsurance Program Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capital Relief**: Allows writing more business with same capital base\n",
    "2. **Catastrophe Protection**: Protects against large natural disaster losses\n",
    "3. **Earnings Stability**: Smooths financial results by ceding volatile risks\n",
    "4. **Expertise Access**: Reinsurers provide underwriting and claims expertise\n",
    "5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets solvency requirements through risk transfer\n",
